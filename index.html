        <div class="content">
          <p>
            An <span class="term">expression | اللفظ </span> has two categories:
          </p>
          <!-- Expressions -->
          <ol>
            <li>
              A
              <span class="term">singular expression | مفرد</span> is an
              expression that refers to a singular meaning, not a part of a
              meaning.
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                e.g. the expression "human" refers to the singular meaning of
                "The Rational Animal". "Hu-" does not refer to rational, and
                "man" does not refer to animal, but rather all of the expression
                refers to a singular meaning.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              A <span class="term">compound expression |مؤلف</span> is an
              expression where different parts of the expression refer to
              different parts of the meaning.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  e.g. the expression "the rock's thrower", where rock indicates
                  a rock, and thrower indicates the act of throwing, and
                  together they refer to the person who throws a rock.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <!-- Singular expressions -->
          <p>
            <span class="term">Singular expressions | المفرد</span> are further
            divided into two categories:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              A <span class="term">universal expression | الكلي</span> is an
              expression that CAN have a subset of expressions that share a
              meaning.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  e.g. the universal expression "human" can have a subset of
                  individual human beings like Aisha bint Abu Bakr, Umar ibn
                  al-Khattab, Ali ibn Abu Talib, who all share the meaning of
                  human.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              A <span class="term">particular expression | الجزئي</span> is an
              expression that CANNOT have a subset of expressions that share a
              meaning.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  e.g. the particular expression "Aisha bint Abu Bakr" cannot
                  have a subset of anything else that shares its meaning.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <!-- Universal Expressions -->

            <span class="term">Universal expressions | الكلي</span> are further
            divided into two categories:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              An
              <span class="term"> essential universal expression | الذاتي</span>
              is an expression that connects to an essential quality of its
              subsets.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  e.g. the essential universal expression "animal" connects to
                  an essential quality of humans, horses, fish, etc., that are
                  subsets of animal.

                  e.g. the nonessential universal expression "beings that laugh"
                  connects to a nonessential quality of human beings, which are

            Let's examine
            <span class="term">The Five Universals | الكليات الخمس </span>.
            Remember that each universal will either fall under the category of
            being <span class="term">essential | الذاتي</span> or
            <span class="term">accidental | العرضي</span>.

            <li>
              The
              <span class="term">genus | الجنس</span> is something that has
              subsets of things that share qualities, when those subsets can
              also have a subset.
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                This universal falls under the

              </li>
              <li>
                e.g. the expression "animal" can have the subsets of humans,
                horses, fish, birds, etc, and humans, horses, fish, birds also
                have their own subsets.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              The <span class="term">species | النوع</span> is something that is
              a subset of a <span class="term">genus | الجنس</span>, i.e., it
              shares qualities with other species, and also has its own subsets.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  This universal falls under the
                  <span class="term">essential | الذاتي</span> category.
                </li>
                <li>
                  e.g. humans, horses, fish, and birds, all share the qualities
                  of being a heterotroph, a multicellular eukaryotic organism,
                  etc. that make them a subset of the genus animal, and they
                  also have their own subsets.

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              The <span class="term">difference | الفصل</span> is the essential
              quality that differentiates a
              <span class="term">species | النوع</span> from all the other
              species within its <span class="term">genus | الجنس</span>.

                </li>
                <li>
                  e.g. the quality of being rational is what differentiates
                  humans from other animals.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              The <span class="term">property |الخاصة</span> is a quality of a
              thing, that is not the essential quality of that thing, but is
              also not shared by other things.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  This universal falls under the

                  e.g. the properties of "having the capability to laugh" and
                  "actually laughing" are not the essential quality of being
                  human, but also are only properties of humans. The former is

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              The <span class="term">general accident | العرض العام</span> is a
              quality of a thing, that is not the essential quality of that
              thing, and it is also shared by other things.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  This universal falls under the

                  e.g. the general accidents "having the capability to breath"

            describes a thing. It has two types:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The
              <span class="term">perfect description | الرسم التام</span> is a
              definition comprised of the
              <span class="term">nearest genus | الجنس القريب</span> and a
              <span class="term">necessary property | الخاص اللازم</span> .

            <ul>
              <li>
                e.g. the perfect description for human is "The laughing animal".
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              The
              <span class="term">imperfect description | الرسم الناقص</span> is
              a description comprised of multiple
              <span class="term">accidents |العرضيات</span>, which together
              specify the thing it is describing.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  e.g. an imperfect description of a human is "Something that
                  walks upon two legs, has opposable thumbs, and walks in an
                  upright manner".

            A
            <span class="term">proposition | القضية</span> has two categories
            regarding whether the two parts of the proposition are comprised of
            <span class="term">singular statements | المفرد</span> or not.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The
              <span class="term">predicative proposition | الحملية</span> is a
              propositon composed of
              <span class="term">singular statements | المفرد</span>. Its two
              parts are called the
              <span class="term">subject | الموضوع</span> and the
              <span class="term">predicate | المحمول</span> .
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                e.g. the predicative proposition "Zayd is a writer" can be said
                to be true or false. "Zayd" is the subject and "writer" is the
                predicate.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              The <span class="term">conditional proposition |الشرطية</span> is
              a proposition comprised of compound statements. Its two parts are
              called the <span class="term">antecedent | المقدمة</span> and the
              <span class="term">consequence |التالي</span>.

            A
            <span class="term">conditional proposition | الشرطية</span> can
            further be broken down into two categories:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The
              <span class="term"
                >conjuctive conditional proposition | الشرطية المتصلة</span
              >
              follows an if-then pattern.
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                e.g. the conjuctive conditional proposition "If the sun rises,
                then it is day time" can be verified or falsified. "If the sun
                rises" is the <span class="term">antecedent | المقدمة</span> and
                "then it is day time " is the

            <ul>
              <li>
                e.g. the disjunctive proposition "In Yemen, it is either day or
                night" can be verified or falsified. "It is either day" is the
                <span class="term">antecedent | المقدمة</span> and "or it is
                night " is the <span class="term">consequence |التالي</span>.
